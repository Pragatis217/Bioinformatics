4.Sequences from which species is/are most closely related to that of the "Flying Fox"?
Pteropus lylei ace2
Dobsonia viridis ace2
Rousettus leschenaultii ace2
Epomophorus wahlbergi ace2
Cynopterus sphinx ace2
Syconycteris australis ace2

5. This phylogeny can be very useful in recent events, particularly in emerging infectious diseases, zoonotic spillover, and viral evolution. Here’s why:
-Zoonotic Disease Risk – Identifies bat species that can act as viral reservoirs (e.g., coronaviruses, Nipah virus).
- Host Shift Prediction – Allows monitoring virus adaptation and spillover potential.
- Conservation  – Supports the conservation of biodiversity while avoiding human-wildlife disease transmission.
- Vaccine & Therapeutics – Guides antiviral development by exploring ACE2 variants in resistant species.
