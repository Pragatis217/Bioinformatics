Assignment 8

1. Species (not human): Labeo rohita (Rohu carp)
2. Gene (not tyrosinase): SLC40A1 (Solute Carrier Family 40 Member 1), also known as ferroportin.
3. Rank 1 target sequence and genomic location: 
Target: SLC40A1
Rank: 1
Target sequence: GTAACTCTTAAAGAGACCGTAGG
Genomic Location: NC_066877.1:27549207
4. Left primer coordinates: NC_066877.1:27549108-27549130
Left primer: TTTCAGGTTTGCCTACAAAAGC
Right primer coordinates: NC_066877.1:27549324-27549346	
Right primer: TACTCAATGCATAAGCACAGCA
5. Expected phenotype if the gene is knocked out: The SLC40A1 gene encodes ferroportin, the sole known iron exporter in vertebrate cells. Knocking out this gene in Labeo rohita is expected to disrupt iron homeostasis, leading to iron accumulation within cells, particularly in the liver and spleen. Phenotypically, this may manifest as anemia, reduced growth rates, compromised immune function, and increased susceptibility to infections due to impaired iron regulation.
