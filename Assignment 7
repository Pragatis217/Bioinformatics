7. This figure illustrates the integration of multiple genomic datasets:

 
       Non-coding OCR peaks: represent regions of accessible chromatin that likely contain regulatory elements like enhancers or promoters. The presence of these peaks in intergenic regions suggests potential regulatory function

    RNA-Seq Data (Red) gene expression: The transcription signal shows active gene expression in this region. Peaks correspond to exons of actively transcribed genes

    Loop: The chromatin loops connect distal regulatory elements (ATAC peaks) with gene promoters
